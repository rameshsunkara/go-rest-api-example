## Tools

1. Routing - [Gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin)
2. Logging - [zerolog](https://github.com/rs/zerolog)
3. Database - [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
4. Container - [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

## TODO

## Why this ?


I embarked on the endeavor of crafting my own open-source boilerplate repository for several reasons:

After years of developing Full Stack applications utilizing ReactJS and JVM-based languages, I observed that existing boilerplate's tended to be either excessive or insufficient for my needs. Consequently, I resolved to construct my own, while adhering rigorously to the principles and guidelines of Go. While similarities with popular Go boilerplate templates may be evident, I have customized this repository to better align with my preferences and accumulated experiences. (My apologies if I inadvertently overlooked crediting any existing templates.)

I yearned for the autonomy to meticulously select the tools for fundamental functionalities such as Routing, Logging, and Configuration Management, ensuring seamless alignment with my personal preferences and specific requirements.

## What this is not ?

- This isn't a complete solution for all your needs. It's more like a basic template to kickstart your project.
- This isn't the best place to begin if you want to make an online store. What I've provided is just a simple tool for managing data through an API.
